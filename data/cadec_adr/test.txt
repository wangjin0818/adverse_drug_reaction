my partner is currently taking this medication liptor , he also takes high blood pressure medication , my reason for initally looking for side effects of liptor was because of my partners decreased libido and to see if there is a connection between this and the medication , however i noticed a small number of people are suffering in this way , i cannot believe the amount of things that are causing such a big problem for so many people taking this drug , my partner is normally very muscular as works out twice a week and has done for years , but over the last 6 mths or so seems to have lost a lot of muscle and replacedit with fat , especially around the midrif , he also suffers from regular dioreaha and muscle pain in back and just below shoulder blades , very often also suffers from headaches , doesnt sleep very well at night at all , also gets tired a lot , my partner isnt aware of this website but i will be definetly showing this to him and advising him to perhaps stop taking this medication for a few weeks to see what the difference is , so glad to have found this site .

Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age , by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years .

I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped .

My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I started taking Lipitor after my cholesterol climbed to 310 .

I Did not want to take it because I am a vegetarian , a health conscious person and dislike taking medicines , but my doctor , an endocrynologist , strongly recommended it .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

The first few months I was not aware of any side effects , but about a month ago I started to experience wrist pain , I thought it was my pilates class , but although I rested for 2 months from the class , the pain continued .

Then about two weeks ago , I got very bad cramps in my toes , they curled down and the pain was terrible .
O O O O O O O O O O ADR O O O O O O O O O ADR O O O 

About a week ago I was taking a bath and my muscles in my lower abdomen started to contract then the cramp got higher .
O O O O O O O O O O O ADR ADR ADR ADR ADR ADR ADR ADR O O ADR O O O 

I got scared that I was having something bad .
O O O O O O O O O O 

After the cramps one night I had such tiredness in my left leg that I could hardly walk , I thought that it was my high heels that I had worn all day .

Then 2 days ago I woke up with a swollen foot , it was very painful to walk .
O O O O O O O O O ADR ADR O O O O ADR ADR ADR O 

That was it .
O O O O 

I suspected that it was the Lipitor and came to the internet and read the same side effects in a lot of people posting their experiences with this drug .
O O O O O O Drug O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

I even thought that I had ALS since a friend of mine died of it .
O O O O O O Disease O O O O O O O O O 

It is amazing the amount of people that also thought the same in this list .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

Thanks God for the Internet .
O O O O O O 

I stopped taking this medicine 2 days ago , I hope that I can get rid of these effects and that they are not permanent .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

I do not recommend it , unless it is life threatening and then only take it for a short time .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

within 2 hours started having heart attack symptoms .
O O O O O ADR ADR ADR O 

Had to go to ER .
O O O O O O 

I was in ER within 3 hours of taking 1 st pill .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

It was scary trying to make sure I had proper observation and not over - reaction because of the symptoms .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

I had to slow people down several times .
O O O O O O O O O 

Now convinced it would have had serious health risks for me had I even tried taking a second pill the next day or even continuing taking them .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

It took a while ( months ) before I started to feel normal again .

My Grandmother is in the hopital with side affect of a storke , the Dr now think that it could be a reaction to Lipitor that she has been taking .

Horrific medication - Suffered an acute pancreatic attack with critical blood levels that almost caused my death .

Then the doctor in charge left us floundering on our own , going from one specialist after another to counter what was happening .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

My children did some research on the web about my drugs that I was taking , which included Voltaren , and learned about the adverse reactions to this drug and I stopped Voltaren .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Drug O O O O O O O O O O O O O Drug O 

The specialists agreed with this conclusion , since they were exact to my problems .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

My body reacted and I recovered gradually .
O O O O O O O O 

My advice to all - STOP - Find something else .
O O O O O O O O O O O 

I lost 2 months of my life and I still don ' t remember the entire e .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O ADR ADR ADR ADR O 

If you are taking this drug - Make absolutely sure that you get blood work done every 6 months , in order to catch any critical levels in your blood .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

Then - STOP - the drug .

After repeated visits to my doctor complaining of these debilitating symptoms he finally made the connection and took me off .

Within 3 days , I started to feel like myself again .
