During my second visiting him , he told me my blood test CK is 90 and my muscle should be OK .

Therefore , I deeply believed that I had side effects by taking lipitor .

Have tried nearly all statins with similar side effects .

now on 80 mg and feeling extremely uncomfortable .

Why am I on 80 mg ?

because the insurance company required a trial at this high level , before I can switch to an alternative and reduce the dose back to 40 mg .

Since when did the insurance company go to med school so they can dictate what I should be on .

I feel that I have become dependent on this medicine to function .

I ' m completeing this on behalf of my father , who died after being prescribed 20 mg Totalip / Atorvastatin , despite the usual dose being 10 mg and him having 2 risk factors , being over 70 and with hypothyroidism .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Drug O Drug O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Disease O 

The inquest verdict was misadventure .
O O O O O O 

The GMC decided that the 20 mg dose was reasonable , and that the GP had not acted inappropriately by prescribing this dose .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

So much for SPCs , PILs , and the CSM ' s Pharmacovigilance reports , all of which state that the usual dose is 10 mg a day , and that statins should be used with caution by patients over 70 and with hypothyroidism .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Disease O 

GPs will continue overprescribing if they are allowed to get away with it .

There is no warning on the prescription bottle , to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol .

The Dr is now doing tests , to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles .

Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180 ' s .

I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240 ' s .

The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor .

I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery .

First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor ' s psychiatric side effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Drug Drug Drug Finding O O O 

He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10 mg Crestor .
O O O O O Drug O O O O O O O O O O Drug O 

In addition , he prescribed a new medication : Niacin , beginning with 500 mg the first month and then increasing to 1 , 000 in the second ( with the ultimate aim of reaching 2 , 000 in the fourth monthly ) .

Bottom line : When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165 .

This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O 

So , after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

Therefore , here is what I ' ve done during the past two months : - Took 500 mg of Niacin during the first months and 1 , 000 mg during the second ; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills ( 10 mg which are equivalent to 20 mg of Lipitor ) per month , i . e . , one every three days .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Drug O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O Drug O O O O O O O O O O O Drug O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

- Two natural pills of Phytosterol .

- A cup of tea made of olive leafs .

Now , I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months ( 2 , 000 mg ) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 ( the level required for diabetics ) .

A question to us about Letter # 48 : What is the evidence of benefit for primary prevention in women ?
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

There were 10 , 990 women in the primary prevention trials ( 28 % of the total ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

Only coronary events were reported for women , but when these were pooled they were not reduced by statin therapy , RR 0 . 98 [ 0 . 85 - 1 . 12 ] .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

Thus the coronary benefit in primary prevention trials appears to be limited to men , RR 0 . 74 [ 0 . 68 - 0 . 81 ] , ARR 2 . 0 % , NNT 50 for 3 to 5 years .
