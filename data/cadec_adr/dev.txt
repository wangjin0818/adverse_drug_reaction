I am the advocate for my father who took this drug for 8 months before he passed from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2005 .

The patient data is reported for him by me .
O O O O O O O O O O 

Briefly , my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer ( glial cell related cancer ) .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ADR ADR ADR ADR ADR ADR ADR ADR O 

That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor - - he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis .

There were no warning signs , deterioration was very fast and debilitating - - he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards .

My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old , had great cholesterol numbers , but he was a cardiac patient .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 ( his lipid profile was very , very good by usual medical standards ) .
O O O O O O O O Drug O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen ( my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father ' s work history experience ) , but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this .

I have tried all the statin drugs , you know the very expensive drug of choice for all the doc ' s out there .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

For all of you who now have extremely low LDL and a bad case of joint pain to the extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug , it is from the statins .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ADR ADR O O O O O O ADR ADR O O O ADR ADR O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

The drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make CoQ 10 .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

This is necessary for they health of muscles and joints ( that ' s why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness ) .

Remember your heart is a muscle , guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the CoQ 10 ? ? ?
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

If you do some research on the internet , you will find that all these statins make no claims / nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks , but they cause muscle problems i . e . your heart , this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and .

I would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130 , neurosurgeons , who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low .
O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O 

And just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don ' t show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn ' t mean the lack of CoQ 10 isn ' t breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly .

While doctors will test your liver function on this medication , and they may run a blood test to check for muscle wasting , many doctors deny that there is a connection between joint pain , muscle aching , fatigue etc and Lipitor .
