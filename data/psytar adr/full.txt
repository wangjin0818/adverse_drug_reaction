The	O
Lexapro	O
alone	O
actually	O
seemed	O

I	O
had	O
used	O
Wellbutrin	O
before	O

experienced	O
more	O

Also	O
had	O
the	O
side	O

of	O

just	O
feeling	O

too	O
often	O
along	O
with	O

The	O
Lexapro	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
made	O
it	O
possible	O
to	O
take	O
Wellbutrin	O
without	O
the	O
negative	O
side	O

I	O

the	O

I	O
was	O
give	O
a	O

sample	O
for	O
60mg	O
which	O
was	O
probably	O
too	O
high	O

what	O

I	O

on	B-ADR
the	I-ADR
verge	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
tears	I-ADR
at	I-ADR
all	I-ADR
times	I-ADR

To	O
add	O
to	O
the	O
constant	B-ADR
emotional	I-ADR
upset	I-ADR
,	O
I	O
can	O
now	O
attribute	O
Cymbalta	O
to	O
frustrating	B-ADR
memory	I-ADR
lapses	I-ADR
and	O
a	B-ADR
dramatic	I-ADR
compromise	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
cognitive	I-ADR
abilities	I-ADR
which	O
I	O
had	O
mistakenly	O
blamed	O
on	O
my	O
pain	O
medication	O
.	O

This	O
drug	O
caused	O
me	O
t	O
.	O
I	O
have	O
severe	B-SSI
and	I-SSI
chronic	I-SSI
lower	I-SSI
back	I-SSI
pain	I-SSI
with	O
Fibromyalgia	B-SSI
which	O
resulted	O
in	O
my	O
developing	O
depression	B-SSI
.	O

Consequently	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
placed	O
on	O
anti	O
-	O
depressants	O
to	O
counteract	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
of	O
pain	O
medication	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
because	O
the	O
constant	B-DI
pain	I-DI
sucked	O
the	O
life	O
out	O
of	O
me	O
.	O

Initially	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
Effexor	O
(	O
YIKES	O

),	O
but	O
had	O
to	O
stop	O
this	O
drug	O
after	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
days	O

Subsequently	O
I	O
was	O
placed	O
on	O
Zoloft	O
for	O
several	O
years	O
,	O
then	O
Celexa	O
for	O
several	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
finally	O
Cymbalta	O
in	O
an	O
effort	O
to	O
decrease	O
the	O
SSRI	O
side	O
effects	O
the	O
first	O
two	O
medications	O
had	O
.	O

Each	O
time	O
I	O
switched	O
drugs	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
stop	O
completely	O
to	O
start	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
no	O
adverse	O
withdrawal	O
side	O
effects	O
from	O
either	O
Zoloft	O
or	O
Celexa	O
;	O
however	O
Cymbalta	O
was	O
a	O
different	O
story	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
tried	O
several	O
times	O
before	O
to	O
quit	O
Cymbalta	O
but	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
extreme	O
withdrawal	O
side	O
effects	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
evidence	O
for	O
me	O
is	O
irrefutable	O
;	O
Cymbalta	O
has	O
absolutely	O
no	O
redeeming	O
value	O
when	O
compared	O
to	O
any	O
other	O
type	O
of	O
SSRI	O
anti	O
-	O
depressant	O
.	O

In	O
Fact	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
should	O
either	O
be	O
removed	O
from	O
the	O
market	O
or	O
be	O
deemed	O
a	O
controlled	O
substance	O
,	O
not	O
because	O
patients	O
would	O
be	O
inclined	O
to	O
abuse	O
this	O

that	O
physicians	O
are	O

to	O
improve	O
mood	O

block	O
pain	O
without	O

to	O
dispense	O

Even	O
the	O
most	O
innocuous	O
of	O

has	O
vastly	O
more	O
therapeutic	O
value	O

your	I-ADR

basically	O
just	O

the	I-ADR

I	O
have	O
tried	O
many	O
different	O
drugs	O
,	O
Effexor	O
being	O
the	O
most	O
recent	O

I	O
tried	O
it	O
for	O
7	O

,	O
and	O
basically	O
had	O
no	O
benefits	O
over	O
that	O
time	O

Every	O
time	O
I	O
mentioned	O
this	O
to	O
the	O
doctors	O
their	O
only	O
advice	O
was	O
to	O
up	O
the	O
dose	O

I	O
was	O
near	O
300	O
mg	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
decision	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
ago	O
to	O
discontinue	O
this	O
drug	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
worth	O
all	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
rather	O
feel	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
anxiety	B-SSI
than	O
to	O
feel	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
a	I-ADR

So	O
now	O
I	O
begin	O
the	O
fun	O
ride	O
of	O

So	O

its	O
been	O
one	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
cutting	O
down	O
the	O

and	O
I	O
am	O
having	O
terrible	B-WD

,	O
am	O
really	B-WD
dizzy	I-WD

wake	B-WD
up	I-WD

I	O
just	O
can	O

wait	O
for	O
this	O

to	O
be	O
out	O
of	O
my	O

so	O
I	O
can	O
feel	O

myself	O
again	O

Apparently	O
Effexor	O
has	O
the	O

higher	O

this	O

it	O
for	O
2	O

it	O
'	O
s	O
a	O
good	O
drug	O
.	O

was	O
initially	O
on	O
Effexor	O
and	O
slowly	O
got	O
up	O
to	O
100	O
mg	O
a	O
day	O
.	O

Was	O
on	O
this	O
for	O
several	O
years	O
,	O
had	O
back	O
surgery	O
and	O
wanted	O
to	O
quit	O
Effexor	O
because	O
I	O
was	O
no	O
longer	O
depressed	B-DI
or	O
in	O
pain	B-DI
.	O

Withdrawal	O
was	O
very	O
,	O
very	O
difficult	O
as	O
many	O
here	O
state	O
.	O

I	O
ended	O
up	O
staying	O
on	O
a	O
maintenance	O
dose	O
of	O
half	O
of	O
a	O
37	O
.	O
5	O
mg	O
tablet	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
year	O
or	O
so	O
on	O
this	O
I	O
had	O
more	B-ADR
spinal	I-ADR
problems	I-ADR
and	O
related	O
nerve	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
.	O

Upped	O
the	O
Effexor	O
to	O
75	O
mg	O
without	O
much	O
pain	O
relief	O
.	O

I	O
now	O
switched	O
to	O
XR	O
150	O
mg	O
for	O
the	O
past	O
six	O
months	O
.	O

HOwever	O
,	O
in	O
thinking	O
about	O
when	O
the	O
pain	O
increased	O
,	O
I	O
realized	O
that	O
it	O
coincided	O
with	O
my	O
switch	O
to	O
a	O
higher	O
dose	O
and	O
XR	O
.	O

To	O
compound	O
the	O
problem	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
Diovan	O
160	O
mg	O
for	O
high	O
blood	O
pressure	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
don	O
'	O
t	O
really	O
know	O
if	O
the	O
increase	O
in	O
pain	O
is	O
related	O
only	O
to	O
the	O
Effexor	O
XR	O
or	O
Diovan	O
also	O
.	O

Overall	O
,	O
Effexor	O
did	O
very	O
well	O
relieving	O
my	O

It	O
helped	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
an	O
antidepressant	O
for	O
18	O
years	O
,	O
most	O
have	O
worked	O
(	O

for	O

)	O
and	O
I	O
switched	O
around	O
to	O
avoid	O
side	O
effects	O
from	O
some	O
and	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
better	O
relief	O
of	O
anxiety	B-DI

None	O

my	O

Effexor	O
has	O
worked	O
for	O
my	O
depression	B-DI
very	O
well	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
alive	O
without	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
started	O
out	O
on	O
Effexor	O
XR	O
75	O
mg	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
slowly	O
raised	O
from	O
there	O
to	O
Effexor	O
XR	O
300	O
mg	O
.	O
Then	O
I	O
was	O
changed	O
to	O
the	O
generic	O
Venlafaxine	O
XR	O
300	O
mg	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
side	O
effects	O
with	O
both	O
of	O
the	O
medications	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
life	O
savor	O
for	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
committed	O
3	O
times	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
2	O
years	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
also	O
getting	O
1	O
on	O

but	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
didn	O
'	O
t	O
have	O
any	O
insurance	O
and	O
the	O
laws	O
changed	O

So	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
start	O
doing	O
group	O
therapy	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
didn	O
'	O
t	O
work	O
.	O

I	O
always	O
wanted	O
to	O
help	O
others	O
instead	O
of	O
helping	O
myself	O

The	O
Effexor	O
XR	O
worked	O
wonderfully	O
for	O
me	O
until	O

I	O
ended	O

The	O

worked	O

for	O
me	O
with	O

until	O
I	O

I	O

that	O

I	O

I	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
taking	O
the	O
Effexor	O
has	O
made	O
me	O
feel	O
so	O
much	O
better	O

I	O
read	O
all	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
and	O
was	O
reluctant	O
to	O
start	O
it	O

knew	O
that	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
take	O
something	O
in	O

I	O
am	O

and	O
it	O
has	O
made	O
a	O
huge	O
difference	O

My	O
advice	O
to	O
anyone	O
considering	O
taking	O
the	O
drug	O
is	O
don	O
'	O
t	O
stress	O
out	O
when	O
reading	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
.	O

All	O
drugs	O
effect	O
people	O
differently	O

Give	O
it	O
a	O
chance	O

It	O
took	O
about	O
14	O
days	O
for	O
the	O
drug	O
to	O
kick	O
in	O

The	O
side	O
effects	O
did	O
go	O
away	O
after	O
about	O
4	O
days	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
increased	O
my	O
dose	O
from	O
37	O
.	O
5	O
mgs	O
to	O
75	O
mgs	O
I	O
didn	O
'	O
t	O
have	O
any	O
side	O
effects	O
,	O
My	O
Dr	O
.	O
prescribed	O
xanax	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
effexor	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
week	O
which	O
actually	O
eliminated	O
the	O
shakiness	O
and	O
nervousness	O
immediately	O
.	O

I	O
only	O
had	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
xanax	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
three	O
days	O
on	O
the	O
Effexor	O
.	O

I	O
suggest	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
decide	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
Effexor	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
xanax	O
on	O
hand	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
few	O
days	O
will	O
help	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
not	O
had	O
to	O
increase	O
my	O
dosage	O
as	O
of	O
yet	O
.	O

I	O
'	O
m	O
hoping	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
the	O
75	O
mgs	O
for	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

Reading	O
about	O
the	O
withdrawals	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
scarey	O
,	O
but	O
like	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
all	O
people	O
are	O
affected	O
differently	O
by	O
different	O
drugs	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
will	O
cross	O
that	O
bridge	O
if	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
get	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

Effexor	O
has	O
made	O
a	O
huge	O
difference	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
when	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
come	O
off	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
experience	O
any	O
withdrawals	O
,	O
well	O
,	O
so	O
be	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
small	O
price	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
being	O
